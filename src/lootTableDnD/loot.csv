Townshend's Cudgel,"Townshend's Crudgels was invented by its namesake, Peter ""Unknown"" Townshend, a traveling bard who wished his lute to both give beauty and take it away (preferably with a good old fashioned thrashing). His lute design, later copied by some of his admirers, was a simple oak lute, reinforced with an iron shell, to maintain the soft vibration of the sound against the wooden interior, and to give the lute the strength to crack open an orc's skull with a well placed blow.
This weapon functions both as a lute and a weapon. When used as a lute, it is considered to be a lute and does not require a separate proficiency bonus to play. However, if the user rolls a critical miss with the weapon (a 1 on an attack roll) the lute may become slightly damaged and will require the user to spend an hour to retune it. If the instrument is not returned, whenever the instrument is played, the user is disadvantaged on the Perform check. This weapon can also be used as a bard's spellcasting focus.

However, he can be convinced to give help in scholarly matters—granting the host +6 on all Knowledge Arcana, Knowledge History, and Spellcraft checks. He is reluctant to give out help unless you have proven yourself a more than worthy host.
