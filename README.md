# Game-tracker v1.2
This will be a modified version of the DnD initiative tracker that I put on Haxme. It will include tracking for additional RPGs and other games such as MTG

-----------------
Changelog:

1.2: Freak added most of the GUI for the loot module
1.1: Freak added the loot table package and set up the skeleton for that module
1.0: Warfox moved the initiative tracker to its own package and made the main class into a menu to select different modules
0.9: Original version by Freak posted on Haxme that only included the initiative tracker
