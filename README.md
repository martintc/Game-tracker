# Game-tracker v1.3a
This will be a modified version of the DnD initiative tracker that I put on Haxme. It will include tracking for additional RPGs and other games such as MTG

----------------
Changelog:

1.3a: Added save & load options to the initiative tracker. DMs may now save in the middle of an encounter (at the top of initiative) and load it back up later. DMs may also add all mobs to a planned future encounter ahead of time to be loaded when the players get to it. Minor optimizations and changes were also made in the loot table package.

1.3: The special rules portion of the loot table package is nearly complete and is useable in its current state. Random loot has not been implemented. The GUI is nearly finished for both rulesets. A new class file may be added in the future for a custom pop-up with loot descriptions because JOptionPane message dialogs do not text-wrap and the current result is hideous. 

1.2: Added most of the GUI for the loot module

1.1: Added the loot table package and set up the skeleton for that module

1.0: Moved the initiative tracker to its own package and made the main class into a menu to select different modules

0.9: Original version by Freak posted on Haxme that only included the initiative tracker
